                        a highly darkened AGN sample was selected with much redder colors than the selection
                        W1[3.6mic]-W2[4.5mic]> 0.8 from Stern et. al (2012). A subgrouphave been classified as AGN between z
                        = 1.6 and 2.3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR14). Thus, we started a pilot study to observe
                        the rest-frame optical spectrum of one the QSO J0206+0105 at redshift z=XXX, in the near-infrared H
                        and K bands. The goal is to investigate the role of dust in the reddening of this type of AGNs, by
                        testing the contribution of the AGN to the spectral energy distribution (SED).

                        Using the anomaly detection algorithm One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM, Solarz et al. 2017),
                        a highly darkened AGN sample was selected with much redder colors than the selection
                        W1[3.6mic]-W2[4.5mic]> 0.8 from Stern et. al (2012). The algorithm has identified more than 40,000
                        sources photometrically consistent with being candidates for previously uncatalogued AGNs. Although
                        most are not found in optical catalogs, a subgroup of 869 sources have been classified as AGN in the
                        version 14 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR14).
    
                        We are currently starting a campaign to observe the rest-frame optical spectrum of the AGN sample
                        between z = 1.6 and 2.3, to investigate its properties, the dust content, the power of the AGN and
                        the nature of its darkening.
                        The pilot test is already underway with the observations of QSO J0206+0105 in the H and K bands of
                        Flamingos-2 in Gemini South. With these observations we will improve the determination of the
                        contribution of the AGN to the spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in this way, remove the
                        degeneracy that exists in the adjustments of SEDs between the contribution of the AGN and the
                        contribution of the dust, to the emission detected in the infrared bands of 250, 350 and 500
                        microns. As a result, it will be possible to investigate the role of dust in the reddening of this
                        type of AGNs.
    
                        Eventually we will extend the spectroscopic monitoring to other similar objects to expand the sample
                        and train the algorithms used in the selection of said objects. As a result, it is expected to
                        improve its identification in large current and near future surveys, such as the "Large Synoptic
                        Survey Telescope" (LSST), to obtain statistically significant samples that allow investigating its
                        evolution and distribution in the large scale structure of the Universe.
