We are building 3D maps of emission line ratios to evaluate the effect of the geometry and the structure of each HII region in the escape of ionizing photons, and to infer properties such as metallicity and ionization state with the spatial resolution provided by the IFS technique. <br>
 The specific objectives from the line ratio maps are: <br>
1) To identify the level of spatial correlation in the maps of the O32 and S32 ratios. <br>
2) To calculate the ionization parameter according to the indicators O32 and S32. <br>
3) To calculate the integrated line ratios over the entire HII region and compare with measurements on spatially resolved elements within the HII region. <br>
4) To calculate fesc from the ratios of integrated lines and the support of theoretical models. <br>
5) To determine if the integrated values are representative of the entire HII region. <br>
6) To identify areas with high fesc probabilities within each observed HII region and analyze their dependence on the theoretical model adopted.

The main activity during the first stage has been data reduction. The data set is composed of twelve positions in SMC-N81 and six positions in SMC-N88A, with two wavelength configurations in each position (blue and red), and three exposures in each configuration. As a result we have 108 science data cubes, plus two cubes of the standard flux star and six cubes of two telluric stars, making a total of 116 data cubes to reduce.

The continuum of the Lyman series was measured between 812 √Ö and 912 √Ö. The UV continuum at 1500 √Ö was measured between 1450 √Ö and 1550 √Ö. The LyC flux of the models presents a greater dispersion than the UV flux, expected for the corresponding temperature range.
